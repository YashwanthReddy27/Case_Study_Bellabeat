### 2.1 Data At Hand

The dataset was generated by Fitbit trackers and is stored in 18 CSV files, each corresponding to different tracked activities. It contains data for 30 users collected between **March 12, 2016** and **May 12, 2016**.  
The data includes various metrics such as:
- Daily activity  
- Heart rate  
- Sleep patterns  
- Steps taken, and more  

The dataset is provided in long format.

---

### 2.2 Limitations

- The dataset is small, with data from only 30 users.  
- It is outdated (from 2016).  
- Data collection is limited to specific days in the week (Tuesday to Thursday only).

---

### 2.3 Does the Data Follow ROCCC?

**ROCCC** stands for:  
**R**eliable, **O**riginal, **C**omprehensive, **C**urrent, and **C**ited.

-  **Reliable**: The data comes from only 30 users who self-reported via Amazon Mechanical Turk.  
-  **Original**: The data was distributed by third-party vendors.  
-  **Comprehensive**: While minute-level data is available for some metrics, the timeframe and population size limit its completeness.  
-  **Current**: The dataset is nearly a decade old (2016).  
-  **Cited**: The original source (Amazon MTurk) is not verifiable or peer-reviewed.

‚û° Overall, the dataset **does not fully meet the ROCCC criteria**.

# 3. Process
I used R to conduct my analysis, as it is easy to use, considering the amount of data we have.

### Install and Load required Packages 
```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("janitor")
install.packages("ggpubr")
install.packages("here")
install.packages("skimr")
install.packages("ggrepel")

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(ggpubr)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(ggrepel)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
```
### Import datasets
For my analysis, I worked on three datasets and imported them into R for my Business Task.
- dailyActivity_merged
- dailyIntenisties_merged
- hourlyCalories_merged
```r
dailyActivity_merged <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
hourlyCalories_merged <- read_csv("hourlyCalories_merged.csv")
dailyIntensities_merged <- read_csv("dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
```
### Display Dataset
```r
head(hourlyCalories_merged)
str(hourlyCalories_merged)
```

### Data Formatting and Preprocessing (Blue Color represents output respectively for corresponding code)
**1. Unique Combinations**
```r
nrow(distinct(dailyActivity_merged, Id, ActivityDate)) 
[1] 940
nrow(distinct(dailyIntensities_merged, Id, ActivityDay))
[1] 940
nrow(distinct(hourlyCalories_merged, Id, ActivityHour))
[1] 22099
```
**2. Duplicates**
```r
> sum(duplicated(dailyActivity_merged))
[1] 0
> sum(duplicated(dailyIntensities_merged))
[1] 0
> sum(duplicated(hourlyCalories_merged))
[1] 0
```
**3. Remove Duplicates and N/A**
```r
Dataser<-Dataset %>% distinct() %>% drop_na()  #inplace of dataset replace with one of the dataset variable where you saved your dataset while reading
```
**4. Renaming columns**
Change the column format to lowercase to maintain consistency.
```r
> dailyActivity_merged <- rename_with(dailyActivity_merged, tolower)
> dailyIntensities_merged <- rename_with(dailyIntensities_merged, tolower)
> hourlyCalories_merged <- rename_with(hourlyCalories_merged, tolower)
```
**5. Cleaning**
Changes the format of columns to ensure consistency. Ex: Replaces spaces and special characters with underscores, removes or substitutes non-ASCII characters, ensures valid R variables.
```r
clean_names(dataset)
```
**6.Date and Time Consistency**
Formatting the Date and time columns of all CSV files for proper consistency.
```r
data <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
hourlyCalories_merged <- hourlyCalories_merged %>% rename(date_time = activityhour) %>% mutate(date_time = mdy_hms(date_time))
dailyIntensities_merged <- dailyIntensities_merged %>% rename(date = activityday) %>% mutate(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
> view(dailyIntensities_merged)
> data <- data %>% 
+    rename(date = activitydate) %>% 
+    mutate(date = as_date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))
> view(data)
```
**7. Merging datasets**
Merging the dailyActivity_merged and dailyIntensities_merged csv files to do the analysis
```r
> dailyActivity_Intensity <- merge(data, dailyIntensities_merged, by = c("id", "date"))
```
# 4. Analyze
Analyzing the above-mentioned datasets to solve the business task at hand.
**1. Summary of the Merged dataset**
I wanted to get the gist of the merged dataset to get the overall summary of the dataset.
```r
> summary_stats <- df %>%
+    summarise(
+        total_steps = sum(totalsteps, na.rm = TRUE),
+        avg_steps   = mean(totalsteps, na.rm = TRUE),
+        total_distance = sum(totaldistance, na.rm = TRUE),
+        avg_distance   = mean(totaldistance, na.rm = TRUE),
+        total_calories = sum(calories, na.rm = TRUE),
+        avg_calories   = mean(calories, na.rm = TRUE)
+    )
total_steps avg_steps total_distance avg_distance total_calories avg_calories
1     7179636  7637.911        5160.32     5.489702        2165393      2303.61
```
**2. Time Series Analysis**
I wanted to check the total steps over different dates to see how they vary 
```r
ggplot(df, aes(x= date, y=totalsteps)) + geom_line() 
> + geom_point() + labs(title ="Total Steps Over Time", x = "Date", y= "Total Steps") + theme_minmal()
```
Total steps over time vs Date: [here](Graphs/1.jpg)

Checked the total distance over different dates to see how they relate to steps
Here, the steps correlate with the distance, so it shows that the steps recorded by the system were proper
```r
ggplot(df, aes(x= date, y=totaldistance)) + geom_line() 
> + geom_point() + labs(title ="Total Distance Over Time", x = "Date", y= "Distance") + theme_minmal()
```
Total distance over time vs Date: [here](Graphs/2.jpg)

Checked the total calories burned over the date
```r
ggplot(df, aes(x= date, y=calories)) + geom_line() 
> + geom_point() + labs(title ="Calories Burned Over Time", x = "Date", y= "Distance") + theme_minmal()
```
Total Calories burned over time vs Date: [here](Graphs/3.jpg)

Finding the correlation between different metrics to analyze the users better

**Correlation between steps and calories**
```r
cor_steps_cal<- cor(df$totalsteps, df$calories, use = "complete.obs")
> print(paste("Correlation bw steps and Calories:", round(cor_steps_cal,2)))
[1] "Correlation between steps and Calories: 0.59‚Äù
```
```r
ggplot(df, aes(x = totalsteps, y = calories)) +
+    geom_point() +
+    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
+    labs(title = "Correlation between Total Steps and Calories",
+         x = "Total Steps",
+         y = "Calories") +
+    theme_minimal()
```

Correlation bw steps and calories: [here](Graphs/4.jpg)

Also, I plotted the steps vs calories over time to better uderstand the relation 
```r
geom_line(aes(y= totalsteps, color ="Steps")) +
+    geom_line(aes(y = calories, color = "Calories")) + 
+    labs(title= "Steps vs Calories over time", x= "Date", y = " Value")+
+    scale_color_manual("", values = c("Steps" = "blue", "Calories" = "red"))+
+    theme_minimal()
```
