## 3. Does the Data Follow ROCCC?

**ROCCC** stands for:  
**R**eliable, **O**riginal, **C**omprehensive, **C**urrent, and **C**ited.

- ❌ **Reliable**: The data comes from only 30 users who self-reported via Amazon Mechanical Turk.  
- ❌ **Original**: The data was distributed by third-party vendors.  
- ⚠️ **Comprehensive**: While minute-level data is available for some metrics, the timeframe and population size limit its completeness.  
- ❌ **Current**: The dataset is nearly a decade old (2016).  
- ❌ **Cited**: The original source (Amazon MTurk) is not verifiable or peer-reviewed.

➡ Overall, the dataset **does not fully meet the ROCCC criteria**.
